> The efficiency gap between NVIDIA and Apple isn't inherent to the silicon. It's an artifact of running generic software on capable hardware.

## Why this exists

Conventional wisdom says NVIDIA GPUs are fast but wasteful, and Apple Silicon is slower but efficient. On paper, that checks out: llama.cpp on an RTX 3090 gets 267 tok/s at 350W (0.76 tok/J), while an M5 Max gets 229 tok/s at ~130W (1.76 tok/J). NVIDIA is faster, but 2.3x worse on efficiency.

We thought the problem was never the hardware. The RTX 3090 has 936 GB/s memory bandwidth and 142 TFLOPS FP16 compute. Extracting only 267 tok/s from that is a software problem.

**The culprit: ~100 kernel launches per token.** Each layer boundary returns control to the CPU, dispatches the next kernel, re-fetches weights from global memory, and synchronizes threads. For 24 layers, those microseconds add up, and each one burns power doing nothing useful.

So we fused everything into one kernel.

## Results

### Decode and Prefill (Qwen 3.5-0.8B)

| Method | Prefill pp520 (tok/s) | Decode tg128 (tok/s) |
|--------|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
| **Megakernel** | **37,800** | **413** |
| llama.cpp BF16 | 11,247 | 267 |
| PyTorch HuggingFace | 7,578 | 108 |

3.4x faster prefill, 1.55x faster decode, 3.8x faster than PyTorch. Same hardware, same model, same weights.

### Energy Efficiency (DVFS Power Sweep)

| Power Limit | Clock | Draw | tok/s | tok/J | vs Stock |
|:-----------:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:--------:|
| 420W (stock) | 1980 MHz | 314W | 433 | 1.38 | baseline |
| 300W | 1935 MHz | 299W | 432 | 1.44 | 99.8% speed, 5% less power |
| **220W** | **1635 MHz** | **220W** | **411** | **1.87** | **95% speed, 30% less power** |
| 150W | 405 MHz | 150W | 194 | 1.29 | too aggressive |

Sweet spot at 220W: 95% of the speed, 30% less power. The curve is nonlinear, tight execution converts directly into saved watts until you starve the GPU too aggressively.

### The Comparison That Shouldn't Exist

| Metric | RTX 3090 (llama.cpp) | M5 Max | RTX 3090 (Megakernel @220W) |
|--------|:--------------------:|:------:|:---------------------------:|
| tok/s | 267 | 229 | **411** |
| Power | 350W | ~130W | 220W |
| tok/J | 0.76 | 1.76 | **1.87** |
| GPU price | ~$400 | $2,499+ (system) | ~$400 |

A $400 GPU from 2020, power-limited to 220W, matches Apple's latest chip on efficiency while delivering 1.8x the throughput.

## How it works

A single persistent CUDA kernel processes the entire Qwen 3.5-0.8B forward pass in one dispatch. No CPU round-trips between layers.

**Architecture:** Qwen 3.5-0.8B is a hybrid model, 18 DeltaNet layers (linear attention with learned recurrence) and 6 full attention layers, in a 3:1 ratio. DeltaNet scales linearly with context length vs. quadratic for standard attention. It's an emerging pattern in next-gen models (Qwen3-Next, Kimi Linear), but no framework had optimized kernels for it.

**Kernel specs:**
- 82 blocks, 512 threads, all SMs on the RTX 3090 kept occupied
- BF16 weights and activations, FP32 accumulation where it matters
- DeltaNet recurrence via warp-cooperative state updates in F32 registers
- Full attention with online softmax (fused QKV, RoPE, causal mask, output projection)
- Cooperative grid sync between layers instead of kernel launches (zero inter-layer overhead)
- KV cache updates in-kernel
- Weights loaded directly from HuggingFace

**What traditional frameworks do:** launch ~100 separate kernels per token, each one paying the cost of CPU dispatch, weight re-fetch, and thread synchronization. The megakernel eliminates all of that.

## Why DeltaNet matters

Standard transformers have years of kernel optimization: FlashAttention, PagedAttention, continuous batching. Hybrid DeltaNet/Attention architectures are newer, and the kernel ecosystem is immature:

- **MLX:** no native DeltaNet kernels
- **llama.cpp:** generic DeltaNet support, no fusion
- **vLLM/SGLang:** Triton kernels via flash-linear-attention, but no megakernel fusion

As more models go hybrid (and they will, because linear attention scales better), what you run them on matters less than *how* you run them. When you write a kernel that actually uses what the GPU offers, tensor cores, shared memory, cooperative grid launches, register-resident state, a five-year-old GPU matches Apple's latest chip.

## Lessons from building this

**`grid.sync()` inside loops will deadlock silently.** We tried synchronizing all blocks within the per-token DeltaNet recurrence loop. No error message, just a hang. The fix: synchronize between layers, not within them.

**Register pressure kills performance quietly.** We attempted `S_TILE=16` for more instruction-level parallelism. Silent crash, no CUDA error, registers spilled to local memory, performance collapsed. `S_TILE=8` was the sweet spot.

**The power curve is nonlinear.** 420W to 300W lost almost nothing (99.8% speed). 300W to 220W lost marginally (95%). 220W to 150W collapsed to 45%. The megakernel's tight execution means the GPU hits its compute ceiling before its power ceiling, until you starve it too aggressively.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luce-Org/luce-megakernel
cd luce-megakernel
pip install -e .
python bench_pp_tg.py    # runs pp520 tg128, prints tok/s and tok/J
```

**Requirements:**
- NVIDIA GPU (Ampere+), tested on RTX 3090
- CUDA 12+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- ~1.5 GB VRAM for BF16 weights

**Optional:** Set a power limit to find your GPU's sweet spot:
```bash
sudo nvidia-smi -pl 220    # or whatever your target wattage
```
